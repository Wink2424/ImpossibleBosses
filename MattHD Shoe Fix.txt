I had the same problem, as it seems most of the problems are depended of your current Game Version and some other small issued. What i did to fix this was:

! Important don't forget to make a backup, because if you fuck up at any time during this your project is completely fucked and you have to restart.

1. Use Unity Version 2018.4.11f
2. Then you follow the tutorial until you imported the new Player Blender File
3. Then you click on the Player Blender File, so that it opens it for you in Blender
4. Then you choose all Collections that are greyed out in the Top-Right of the Screen(Pants, Boots, Hair etc.) with ALT and Right Click
5. Right-Click again, Visibility, Then you have to activate, Enable in Viewport and Enable in Renderer
6. Then Leave Blender and Save Changes
7. Your Player Model should now be fixed
